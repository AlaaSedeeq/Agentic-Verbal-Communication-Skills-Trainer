      "user_input": "Good afternoon. Today we'll explore three key strategies for combating climate change.\nFirst, transitioning to renewable energy sources. Solar and wind power adoption has increased 40% since 2015.\nSecond, sustainable agriculture practices. Regenerative farming can sequester up to 10 tons of CO2 per acre annually.\nFinally, policy interventions. Carbon pricing mechanisms have proven effective in 23 countries.\nIn conclusion, by combining technological innovation, agricultural reform, and legislative action, \nwe can create a sustainable future. The time to act is now.",
