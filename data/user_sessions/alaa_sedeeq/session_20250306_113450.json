Your writing sometimes feels a bit disjointed and jumps around without clear transitions.\n\nTo help you get more cohesive, I'd like you to practice writing a few paragraphs that link together smoothly. Can you try writing a short section that uses transitional phrases to guide the reader through your ideas?"
